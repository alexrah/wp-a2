Add a real newsletter service to your blog. In seconds. For free.

== Description ==

This plug-in lets you collect subscribers on your blog with a single or double opt-in
subscription process. Double opt-in is law compliant and it means the user has to confirm the subscription
following simple standard instructions sent to him via email.

Newsletter 2.5 works.

Take the time to read the user guide, to configure
it as if it would be a new installed plug-in, to enter the subscription form panel and
configure it. Read the user guide about WordPress cron system and how it can affect
the sending process. If you need to translate the subscription form, use the
subscription form panel, please, do not hack the language files, they are
used only on activation. On some WordPress installations the automatic update does not
trigger the activation process. It's important, so try to deactivate and reactivate the
plug-in if it does not saves e-mails. If you update manually uploading the plug-in
with FTP, deactivate it first and the reactivate.

Please, DO NOT hack the plug-in files and then, when things go wrong, try to solve
the problem writing me... I have no time to answer to all. Reinstall if you're in doubt
about the plug-in integrity.

Thank you.

Each step of subscribe and cancel process is fully configurable and translatable.

Subscription form and profile form are easily configurable from administrative panels and you
can translate every single label in your language.

Create e-mails with a visual editor with the auto compose function which extract content
for your blog. Auto composer themes can be customized.

Use the widget to let users to subscribe from anywhere in your blog or use a short code
to embed the subscription form on posts and pages.

Use the locked content feature to fire up the subscription rate.

Any option has a "hints" box with instruction to set it and the full user guide is
inside the administrative panels.

Version 2.5 is a major update and need to be reconfigured! Pay attention.
